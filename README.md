# ED-CompanionAppsLauncher
The instal program replaces EDlaunch.exe file while keeping it under changed name true_EDlaunch.exe. It also copies other necessary files to run.  The program itself runs shortcuts placed in folder ShortcutsToLaunch before launching the game. All this is written as a AutoHotkey script.
