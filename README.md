The instal program replaces EDlaunch.exe file while keeping it under changed name true_EDlaunch.exe. It also copies other necessary files to run. 
The program itself runs shortcuts placed in folder ShortcutsToLaunch before launching the game. All this is written as a AutoHotkey script.

Instal process if you have ED installed in default place:
1. Run InstallCompanionAppsLauncher.
2. Place the shortcuts you want inside the folder "ShortcutsToLaunch" placed inside ED files.

Instal process if you don't have ED installed in default place:
0. Do all this in ED folder.
1. Change file EDLaunch.exe name inside to true_EDlaunch.exe
2. Copy CompanionAppsLauncher.exe inside ED files and change it's name EDLaunch.exe. 
3. Create a folder called ShortcutsToLaunch in the same folder as EDLaunch.exe and place there shortcuts you want to run while launching the game.

Uninstall process if UnistallCompanionAppsLauncher.exe doesn't work:
1. Delete EDLaunch.exe and ShortcutsToLaunch folder.
2. Change name of the true_EDlaunch.exe file to EDLaunch.exe.
